Contributions are welcomed with open arms, provided they adhere to the following:

1. A proposal should not add an unecessary level of complexity to the project, as it's primary goal is always to serve as the simplest possible VM for learning purposes.
2. All proposals should originate from an issue.
3. Any pull request addressing a proposal should target a specific concern - i.e. it should not address multiple different issues in the same pull request. This is so that any individual piee of change can be discussed.
4. A pull request should not modifiy the overall coding style used in the project. It should not change the formatting of other parts of the code. All the standard rules apply: Good meaningful names, limit magic numbers, etc.
5. Code added should be tested. Existing tests should not break. Test code should not be removed unless the associated code was also removed.
